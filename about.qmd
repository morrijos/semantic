I'm Joshua Morrison, a Data Scientist and public health informatics professional. I use data from medical claims and electronic health records to inform healthcare _quality_ measurement, especially for patients with chronic conditions. I'm also an aspiring semantic data specialist with an eye toward healthcare interoperability and AI applications. I'll be using this site to chronicle my self-led study of semantic data tools.
