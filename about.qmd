I'm Joshua Morrison, a Data Scientist and public health informatics professional. I use large-scale claims and electronic health record data to inform healthcare quality measurement, especially for patients with chronic conditions. I'm an aspiring semantic data specialist; I'll be using this site to chronicle my self-led study of semantic data tools.
